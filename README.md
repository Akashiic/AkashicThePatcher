# AkashicThePatcher

Client-side bug-patch coremod bundle for the **Forbidden Series** Minecraft **1.7.10** modpack: Forge coremod + Mixins that fix crashes, startup time and compatibility problems in other mods at class-load time.

This repository is the **complete recorded history** of the project, reconstructed from the author's files: **39 builds** from `1.1.0-beta.3` (2026-09-08) to `1.1.0-beta.36-ForestryC2CompileBarrier` (2026-10-24, current), with each build's checkpoints, audits, tools, source (where it exists), the investigations behind them, and the provenance of every file.

> Portuguese version: [README.pt-BR.md](README.pt-BR.md)

## Layout

```
releases/<tag>/        the JARs (39) + releases/SHA256SUMS.txt
versions/<folder>/     per-build checkpoint docs, audits, build tools, recovered source
projects/              AsyncCompat-family Gradle projects (source of the dev.akashic.asynciconcompat component)
investigations/        experiments, A/B configs and test harnesses (world-render hunt, Forestry C2 crash)
analysis-tools/        scripts used to diff and compare builds
data/                  machine-readable: manifest, excluded files, lineage, commit plan
docs/                  everything above
```

Git tags `v1.1.0-beta.*` correspond to `releases/` folders; every tag also has a GitHub Release with the JAR attached and its SHA-256.

## Which JAR do I install?

The newest, `!Akashic-ThePatcher-1.1.0-beta.36-ForestryC2CompileBarrier.jar` (SHA-256 `45a00f1ea27778d9d01d392180c1a3980e440370beeb84ec0af9213e836e2bf4`). It replaces beta.35 and no longer depends on the launcher passing JVM arguments for the Forestry C2 crash (works with Technic, SKLauncher and others). Do **not** install the two builds marked `REJECTED` (beta.28) or the diagnostic/probe builds unless you are reproducing an investigation. Other pack-side requirements are in [docs/HANDOFF.md](docs/HANDOFF.md).

## Honest caveats

* **Dates are file modification times** of the JARs; the git history is a *reconstruction*, one commit per build in chronological order, not the real development history.
* beta.1, 2, 5 and 6 do not exist on disk. Sources of the core bundle (`com.akashic.thepatcher.*`) are not available; beta.35's changed class is only available as a decompilation.
* The white/translucent world rendering bug that drove betas 9-28 has **no recorded fix**.
* Third-party binaries (Angelica, Forestry, GTNHLib, the Technic pack, a Minecraft client derivative) and anything private (launcher settings, server addresses, credentials) are **not** included - see [docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md) and `data/excluded.tsv`.
* **No license has been chosen yet**, so by default all rights are reserved by the author; reading and cloning is possible, reuse needs the author's permission.

## Verify integrity

```
sha256sum -c releases/SHA256SUMS.txt      # run from the repository root; on Windows: certutil -hashfile <jar> SHA256
```
Every other file's expected hash is in `data/manifest.tsv`. Two files under `versions/...beta.9-MPS-Angelica/` were moved to a shorter directory so the repository clones on Windows; see `data/relocated.tsv`.
